**peep is a tweak that allows you to temporarily hide your status bar by tapping on it.**
- peep supports hiding in apps, on the lockscreen and on the homescreen seperately!

The settings instantly apply *without* the need to respring your device, but if you do respring, your status bar state will be saved!

**Current preferences options**:
- Enable / Disable
- Use Animations

**Notes:**
- peep is [open source](https://github.com/cbyrne/peep), be sure to check out the code if you're interested.
- If you have an issue, [create an issue here](https://github.com/cbyrne/peep/issues/new).
